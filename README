This is the backend of the Radar app, this is my first attempt with ReSTful APIs, so you might see some quirks. Some mistakes made in this attempt are that I used POST for everything, and used verbs instead of just nouns with GET/POST/PUT/DELETE. So note that!

But other than that, you should see some nice use of unit testing (Which saved my ass during the hackathon!)

Enjoy.

Technologies employed:
* Flask python microframework
* Unit testing
* Fabric
* ReST
